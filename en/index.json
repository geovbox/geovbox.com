Despite extensive research into the deformation mechanisms of the fore-limb in the hanging wall folds, the factors influencing back-limb deformation remain relatively underexplored. This study employs a series of discrete-element simulations to investigate the evolution of ramp related folding, particularly focusing on the factors governing the development of back-thrusts. Comparative analyses reveal diverse deformation styles within the hanging wall of a ramp fold. Notably, when the upper layer exhibits significantly greater strength relative to the lower layer, and an intermediate décollement exists between them, decoupled deformation occurs, characterized by back-thrusting predominantly in the lower layer. This phenomenon is analogous to the deep thrust belts beneath the Shizigou anticline in the western Qaidam Basin, northern Tibetan Plateau, where multiple hydrocarbon-bearing layers have been identified. The findings offer significant insights into the mechanisms of thrust-related folding, thereby improving efficient hydrocarbon exploration in relevant regions. Furthermore, unlike the commonly reported nucleation of a fault ramp from the basal d ́ecollement or at an intermediate level, our observations indicate initiation from the shallow section. The detailed mechanism underlying such differential deformation warrant further investigation.\n    Fig. 1.

In the absence of an intermediate d ́ecollement, the lower layer is configured with a bonding parameter set T2, whereas the upper layers are assigned parameter sets T1 through T4 for the Experiments 1 to 4, respectively.

Conclusions The results of our discrete-element numerical simulations concerning the back-limb deformation during ramp folding lead to the following conclusions. (1) The vertical heterogeneity in stratal strength under ramp folding has a significant influence on the development of back-thrusts. When the upper and lower layers exhibit uniform mechanical properties, a through-going fault is more likely to develop along the axial plane of the fold.

Seismic data reveal extensive polygonal fault systems (PFSs) in the input sequences of the Hikurangi Margin and Nankai Trough. The mechanical and hydrological effects of these incoming PFSs on subduction zones are potentially substantial. Here, we investigate their effects following transport into the accretionary wedge by integrating discrete- element modeling with three- dimensional seismic interpretation. We find that the typical dips of the incoming PFSs over lap with modeled dips prone to reactivation and confirm that subducting PFSs can be reactivated and gradually evolve into major thrust faults. Comparisons with electromagnetic data indicate that PFSs may provide conduits for fluid leakage along the plate interface, coincide with disrupted strata and decreased shear stress, and enhance geometric and stress heterogeneity along the megathrust. These suggest that PFSs may play a previously unrec ognized role in contributing to shallow slow earthquake phenomena in subduction zones\n    Figure 2.

In particular, the evolution of its internal structures and the mechanisms that govern deformation propagation require further research. This study focuses on the Ziliujing anticline located in the southwestern Sichuan Basin, China. It provides an in-depth analysis of the structural development and evolution of the frontal zone of the SW Sichuan FTB, which has propagated from the southeast to the northwest. Through detailed interpretation of seismic reflection profiles and quantitative area-depth-strain (ADS) analysis, we have identified three distinct stages of tectonic shortening corresponding to the Caledonian, Indosinian, and Yanshan-Himalayan orogenic periods. These findings are consistent with the established history of regional tectonic evolution. Furthermore, discrete-element numerical simulations demonstrate that the pinch-out of the basal décollement exerts a significant influence fault development and the formation of overlying fold patterns during multi-stage tectonic deformation. During the initial phase, deformation progressively propagates forward until it reaches the tip of the décollement, where subsequent deformation becomes predominantly localized. The decoupling effect induced by the intermediate décollement facilitates the continued forward propagation of underlying deformation. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the multi-stage compressional deformation of salt-bearing fold-thrust belts and the critical factors governing the propagation of deformation from mountain ranges to basins.\n    Fig. 1.

Here, we investigated the structural and mechanical evolution of the Weiyuan anticline and its relationship with HF‐induced earthquakes using seismic interpretation, the discrete‐element method (DEM), and three‐dimensional structural modeling. Interpretation of the seismic reflection profiles revealed a basement‐involved wedge structure and two west‐dipping multi‐bending thrust ramps in the basement. East of the Weiyuan anticline, extensive small‐ displacement thrust faults developed between the Cambrian and Silurian shale detachments in the sedimentary cover. DEM simulation showed that the structural wedge formed by the underlying blind thrust ramp and back thrust (BT) controlled the Weiyuan anticline formation. With increased shortening, the fault slip continued to propagate east of the Weiyuan anticline along the Cambrian detachment, leading to the development of extensive thrust faults. 3‐D structural modeling showed that M \u0026gt; 4 induced earthquakes were primarily located on a BT in the structural wedge, while M \u0026lt; 4 events were distributed along the hydro‐fractured Silurian shale and Cambrian detachment. Densely developed thrust faults in the sedimentary cover connect the overpressured Silurian shale to the Cambrian detachment, promoting the downward diffusion of fluid pressure and favoring micro‐small M \u0026lt; 4 induced seismic events. This study provides new insights into the seismic hazard assessment of HF development in fold‐and‐thrust belts.\n     Figure 1.

Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42120104004) and the “Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program” (Grant No. 2019QZKK0708), they conducted discrete element numerical simulations using the ZDEM software (Changsheng Li, 2019) and performed stress-strain analysis (Morgan, 2015) to systematically investigate the influence of intermediate detachment layers on the structural vergence of the underlying thrust system.\nDiscrete Element Numerical Simulation Results Show:\n Under conditions where the basal detachment layer is extremely weak (μ = 0), by varying the strength, thickness, and burial depth of the intermediate detachment layer, we successfully reproduced all types of thrust wedges (i.e., forethrusting, doubly vergent thrusting, and backthrusting) in the thrust system beneath the intermediate detachment layer. This indicates that the properties of the intermediate detachment layer determine the structural vergence of the underlying thrust system, challenging the traditional view that a single detachment layer only controls the structural vergence of the thrust system directly above it. Specific combinations of the intermediate detachment layer’s properties (strength, thickness, and burial depth) and shortening rate are critical for the development of backthrust-dominated thrust wedges in the underlying thrust system. Mechanically, these parameter combinations may determine the magnitude of friction exerted by the upper thrust system on the lower thrust system. Therefore, we propose that frictional interactions between different thrust systems may provide a new mechanism for the formation of backthrust-dominated thrust wedges. Combining geological and geophysical observations, we suggest that the variation in structural vergence above the widely distributed basal detachment layer (Hormuz Salt) along the strike of the Zagros Simply Folded Belt may result from differences in the strength, thickness, and burial depth of the intermediate detachment layer (Gachsaran Evaporites) along the strike. Thus, we propose that future research should focus on the interactions between thrust systems at different scales.   Zhou, C., He, J., Su, H., Ruh, J.B., Wang, X., Wang, W., Wang, X., Pan, Z. (2025).

The KFB, located in the northern Tarim Basin, is characterized by its Cenozoic compressional salt structures. The KFB in the northern Tarim Basin hosts prominent Cenozoic compressional salt structures, with surface-exposed salt-related features being rare yet significant The QFTB is situated along the southern margin of the KFB, to the north of the Baicheng Depression–Yiqikelike Structural Belt, and to the south, it is adjacent to the Tabeishan Uplift–Yangxia Depression(Fig 1). Laterally, it is positioned between the Wensu Uplift and the Tuerke Ming Structural Belt(Wang et al 2017; Xie et al, 2014; Li et al 2020; He et al 2023; Ju et al 2023;Zhu et al 2024).\n  Fig 6 Structural interpretation of the A-A\u0026#39; Profile. Profile A-A’ of the Central Qiulitage Segment (Fig 6) is located about 7 km from the paleo-uplift, where the detachment layer of the Jurassic-Triassic strata is approximately 1,000 m thick. This thickness exceeds that of the detachment layer in the Dongqiu area (800 m) and the Dina area (600 m). The region features dual salt layers, including the Jidike Formation salt layer (approximately 800 m thick) and the Kumugeliemu Formation salt layer (about 150 m thick).Fault-bend folds are predominantly developed beneath the salt layers. Fault F1 has a cutting angle of 29°, a horizontal thrust distance of about 500 m, and a structural width of 2 km. Fault F2 has a cutting angle of 26°, a horizontal thrust distance of about 500 m, and a structural width of 4 km. Similarly, Fault F3 has a cutting angle of 25°, a horizontal thrust distance of about 300 m, and a structural width of 3km.In the northernmost section, Y-shaped faults (part of the Kelasu structural belt) are observed. Together with the Qiulitage fold-thrust belt, they form the thrust-nappe system of the Kuqa Depression. Above the salt layers, counterthrust blocks are evident, and growth strata in the Kangcun Formation suggest that the main tectonic activity occurred during the Himalayan orogeny.The Central Qiulitage Segment is characterized by a relatively thick lower detachment layer and the development of dual salt layers, forming multi-detachment-layer folding deformation. The paleo-uplift’s obstruction effect is most pronounced here, leading to smaller fault dip angles, shorter thrust distances, and the forward propagation of three imbricate caprock-detachment faults.\n  Fig 7 Structural interpretation of the B-B\u0026#39; Profile The Profile B-B’ of the Eastern Qiulitage Segment(Fig 7), located about 12 km from the paleo-uplift, the Jurassic-Triassic detachment layer is approximately 800 m thick, which exceeds the thickness in the Dina area (600 m). This region belongs to the Jidike Formation salt development zone, where the average salt layer thickness is about 600 m. Fault-bend folds dominate the structural deformation beneath the salt layer. Fault F1 has a cutting angle of 24°, a horizontal thrust distance of about 3 km, and a structural width of 7 km. Secondary faults are developed, forming box-shaped folds. Fault F2 has a cutting angle of 21° and a horizontal thrust distance of about 300 m.Secondary faults related to Fault F2 disrupt the integrity of the anticline structure.Above the salt layer, fault-related folds are visible, and growth strata in the Kangcun Formation suggest that the main tectonic activity occurred during the Himalayan orogeny.The Eastern Qiulitage section is characterized by a relatively thick lower detachment layer, which results in smaller fault dip angles.

However, the nature and formation process of the Qiyueshan Fault remain debated, resulting in significant discrepancies in understanding the formation and evolution mechanisms of the Xuefengshan foreland fold-and-thrust belt. To investigate the formation of the Qiyueshan Fault and its control on differential deformation on both sides, seismic reflection profiles were interpreted, and five discrete element numerical simulation models were designed for experimental analysis. The results reveal that pre-existing faults localize deformation and influence the sequence of fault generation. In contrast, without pre-existing faults, deformation predominantly propagates along the lower detachment layer under weak cohesion. When the thickness of the middle detachment layer exceeds that of the lower detachment layer, deformation is governed by the middle detachment layer, leading to partial decoupling of the competent layers above and below it. Based on a comparison with seismic reflection profiles, the Xuefengshan foreland fold-and-thrust belt is characterized as a “double-step fault-bend fold system.” The Qiyueshan Fault formed during progressive deformation of the foreland belt, and the structural differences across the fault are primarily controlled by the distribution of the basal detachment layer and the mechanical properties of the Cambrian detachment layer. The Western Hunan fold-and-thrust belt is governed by deep-seated fault-bend folding, while the Eastern Sichuan fold-and-thrust belt is controlled by shallow fault-bend folding.\n  Fig.5 Progressive evolution of model 1(a) in shortening 14 km(b), 28 km(c), 42 km(d) and the corresponding volumetric strain ((e)-(g))   Fig.6 Progressive evolution of model 2 (a) in shortening 14 km(b), 28 km(c), 42 km(d) and the corresponding volumetric strain ((e)-(g))   Fig.7 Progressive evolution of model 3(a) in shortening 14 km (b), 28 km (c) and 42 km (d), and the corresponding volumetric strain ((e)-(g))   Fig.8 Progressive evolution of model 4(a) in shortening 14 km(b), 28 km(c), 42 km(d) and the corresponding volumetric strain ((e)-(g))   Fig.9 Progressive evolution of model 5(a) in shortening 14 km(b), 28 km(c), 42 km(d) and the corresponding volumetric strain ((e)-(g)) Conclusion Based on five sets of discrete element numerical simulation experiments, the results indicate that the deformation on both sides of the Xuefengshan foreland fold-thrust belt and the Qiyueshan fault is primarily controlled by the distribution and mechanical properties of the basement detachment layer and the Cambrian detachment layer. The comprehensive analysis suggests:\n  When multiple sets of detachment layers exist and the cohesive strength is relatively low, stress is primarily transmitted along the lower detachment layer.\n  When the intermediate weak detachment layer is thicker than the lower one, deformation is dominated by the intermediate detachment layer, with slight decoupling occurring in the competent layer between the two. Faults generated by the basement detachment layer may become deflected.\n  The Qiyueshan fault was formed during progressive deformation. The deformation differences on both sides of the fault are mainly governed by the distribution of the basement detachment layer and the mechanical properties of the Cambrian detachment layer. The Silurian and Triassic detachment layers play a secondary, regulating role, which explains the limited exposure of breakthrough structures at the surface.\n  The Xuefengshan foreland fold-thrust belt exhibits a dual-layer, stepwise fault-bend fold structure characterized by “fault-flat–fault-ramp–fault-flat–fault-ramp.” The eastern Sichuan fold-thrust belt represents a shallow fault-bend fold zone, while the western Hunan fold-thrust belt represents a deeper one.

These findings demonstrate that the preferential deformation of distal pre-existing faults is mechanically controlled by a weak basal décollement layer.Combining geological and geophysical observations, we suggest that the early deformations observed in the northern Tibetan and Iranian Plateaus shortly after the collision of the Arabian and Indian plates with the Eurasian plate are likely the result of the preferential reactivation of pre-existing faults (weak zones) under the influence of a weak lower crust(Zhou et al., 2024)。\n Zhou, C., He, J., Su, H., Wang, W., Wang, X., Zhao, Y., Jiang, Y.

However, in the northern Tibetan and Iranian Plateaus, far away from the southern collision zones, widespread deformation occurs soon after collisions of Arabia and India with Eurasia. Additionally, despite the prevalence of weak lower crust and distal pre-existing faults or weak zones, their relationship to early distal deformation remains poorly understood. For this reason, we run systematic experiments of discrete element models involving basal d´ecollement layer as well as distal pre-existing fault.

Based on the latest three-dimensional seismic data and discrete element numerical simulation methods, this paper conducts detailed geological modeling of the area, simulates its formation and evolution process, and discusses the controlling factors of differential deformation. In the Awate area, the subsalt strata are characterized by long-distance thrusting along the Keping Thrust Fault, forming two sets of superimposed thrust systems detached along the coal seams of the Jurassic; the suprasalt strata developed the relatively thin Awate Depression; salt structures are mainly unconformity-related. In the Boz area, the subsalt strata show high-angle basement-involved deformation north of the Keping Thrust Fault and detachment along coal seams to the south, forming an overall wedge-shaped imbricate thrust structure; the suprasalt strata developed the thick Baicheng Depression; salt structures are mainly conformity-related. Simulation results indicate that the Wensu Paleo-uplift limited the depositional extent of the Mesozoic to Paleogene strata and hindered the forward propagation of deformation, which is the most important reason for the differential deformation between the Awate and Boz areas. Preexisting salt diapir structures and the differential compression of the South Tianshan also have a certain controlling effect on the differential deformation in this area. The evolutionary process inferred from the integrated interpretation of seismic profiles and numerical simulation results shows that the tectonic activity in this area has a trend of increasing intensity, with structural deformation beginning during the deposition of the Jidike Formation in the early Middle Miocene and a significant tectonic acceleration event occurring after the deposition of the Kangcun Formation in the early Pliocene.\n    Fig. 4 Initial model design of Experiment 1 (a) and Experiment 2 (b)   Fig. 5 Interpretation scheme of Profile AA   Fig. 6 Interpretation scheme of Profile BB   Fig. 7 Interpretation scheme of Profile CC   Fig. 8 Simulation results and structural interpretation of Experiment 1   Fig. 9 Simulation results and structural interpretation of Experiment 2 Conclusions Through detailed three-dimensional seismic interpretation, the structural deformation styles of the Awate and Boz areas in the western Kuqa Depression are clarified, and the similarities and differences between the two are compared. Using the discrete element numerical simulation method, the structural evolution processes of the two areas are simulated, and the controlling factors leading to their differential structural deformation are discussed. The main conclusions are as follows:\n The subsalt deformation in the Awate area is characterized by long-distance thrusting along the Keping Thrust Fault, forming two sets of superimposed detached thrust systems; salt structures are mainly unconformity-related salt pillows, salt tongues, and salt nappes; the suprasalt strata developed the relatively thin Awate Depression.

Previous studies focused on the migration characteristics of the East China Sea Shelf Basin but ignored the formation mechanism of differential fault evolution, lacking in-depth research on the controlling factors of fault development processes. The northern Pingbei Slope Zone of the Xihu Depression is a fault terrace area composed of seaward-dipping faults, while the southern part is a half-graben area composed of landward-dipping faults. The differential fault evolution indicates the basin formation process of the East China Sea Shelf Basin. This paper simulates the formation and evolution of landward-dipping and seaward-dipping faults through discrete element numerical simulation to explore the controlling factors of fault geometric development characteristics. The results show that lithological differences have a significant impact on the fault evolution of the slope zone. Rupture of strata with higher shear strength is prone to produce landward-dipping basin-controlling faults, while rocks with lower shear strength are prone to form seaward-dipping faults. The direction of stress is an important controlling factor for regional differential evolution. When the rock strength is the same, and the stress direction is opposite, the fault dip is also opposite. Numerous depression slopes developed during the basin formation process, but the slope is not the dominant factor in differential fault evolution. The differential evolution of the Pingbei Slope Zone and marginal sea basins may be caused by differences in basement strength or stress direction. This paper uses discrete element numerical simulation to study the differential evolution process of faults in the Pingbei Slope Zone, providing insights and theoretical basis for the tectonic evolution mechanism of the East China Sea Basin and the formation of marginal sea basins.\n    Fig. 5 Model boundary conditions for discrete element numerical simulation   Fig. 6 Structural deformation, volumetric strain, and fault displacement statistics of Model 1   Fig. 7 Structural deformation, volumetric strain, and fault displacement statistics of Model 2   Fig. 8 Structural deformation, volumetric strain, and fault displacement statistics of Model 3   Fig. 9 Structural deformation and volumetric strain of Model 4   Fig. 10 Structural deformation, volumetric strain, and fault displacement statistics of Model 5 Conclusions  Rock strength and stress direction are the main factors affecting changes in fault dip. High-strength rock rupture produces faults opposite to the direction of extension, while low-strength rock rupture produces faults in the same direction as extension. Rocks with the same strength produce completely opposite main fault dips under the influence of opposite stress directions. The slope of the bedrock surface and the position of stress application are not the dominant factors in differential fault evolution. The differential evolution of marginal sea basins in eastern China may be controlled by differences in basement strength and stress direction.

The SWSB experienced forward-breaking propagation during the Cenozoic. The current dynamic mechanisms controlling the thrusting and the control mechanisms of the two detachments on the structural deformation pattern of the SWSB still require in-depth research. This paper designs three comparable discrete element numerical models. In these models, the shallow detachment has the same parameters, but different mechanical strengths and thicknesses are designed for the basal detachment to explore the influence of different basal detachment strengths on the formation and evolution of the SWSB. Model I is characterized by a strong frictional basal detachment, exhibiting forward-breaking thrusting towards the foreland in both deformation phases. Most deformation and thrust faults are concentrated near the active backwall, accompanied by the development of imbricate structures and two pop-up structures. For the geometric parameters of the wedge on the left side of Model I, it shows the characteristics of “linearly increasing wedge height” and “stepwise increasing wedge width and slope angle”. Model II has a basal detachment thickness of 500 m and moderate friction. In this model, stress and strain propagate rapidly into the foreland, and multiple thrust and back-thrust faults form on the upper detachment during the second compression phase. The deformation process of Model II during the first compression phase is similar to that of Model I. However, in the second compression phase, the wedge reaches a stable state, and its geometry remains unchanged, with deformation propagating along the shallow detachment to the right side of the model. Model III has a larger basal detachment thickness and moderate friction, and the geometry and activity of thrust faults in its foreland are significantly different from the other models. In the second compression phase of this model, two additional pop-up structures are generated. The first half of the first compression phase is similar to the first two models. In the second half of the first compression phase and the second compression phase, the wedge is in a stable state. Notably, all models undergo a transition from a subcritical state to a supercritical state during the first stage of shortening, indicating that deformation is rapidly propagating along the basal detachment towards the right side of the model. Overall, Model III more accurately reflects the deformation characteristics of the SWSB, indicating a strong correlation with the evolution of this region. These models help to understand the deformation process and formation mechanism of the SWSB and can provide a reference for hydrocarbon exploration beneath the shallow detachment.

Preexisting basement structures play a crucial role in the process of salt structural deformation. Using the latest two-dimensional and three-dimensional seismic data, combined with discrete element and finite element numerical simulation methods, this study investigates the types and distribution of preexisting structures and their control on salt structures. Seismic data analysis indicates that the preexisting structures developed in the Kuqa Depression mainly include basement faults, paleo-uplifts, subsalt slopes, and early passive salt diapirs. Basement faults are mainly distributed in the Kelasu and Qiulitag structural belts, controlling the development location and deformation style of the Miocene compressional salt structures. Differences in the deformation style and reactivation degree of basement faults have led to the diversity of salt structures in different structural belts. Paleo-uplifts mainly include the Wensu Uplift, western Qiulitag Uplift, Xinhe Uplift, and Yaha-Luntai Uplift; paleo-uplifts limited the original sedimentary extent and later deformation space of the salt layer, resulting in strong salt thrusting in different structural layers of the Awate Sag in the western Kuqa Depression. The non-uniform spatial distribution of paleo-uplifts also promoted the development of large-scale strike-slip transfer zones in the western part of the depression. Subsalt slopes are mainly located on the northern margin of the western Qiulitag low uplift, hindering the southward flow of salt and forming large-scale salt domes at the edge of the slopes, with the size of these domes being closely related to the dip of the subsalt slopes. Early passive salt diapirs are mainly developed in the Quele and Bozidun areas of the western Kuqa Depression, and they were preferentially active during the post-Miocene compressional period, forming a piercement salt nappe. Numerical simulation results show that preexisting structures have a strong control on the stress-strain distribution during salt structural deformation, often causing stress concentration of maximum principal stress and shear stress, thereby inducing the preferential formation of salt structures. Seismic data and numerical simulation results indicate that the spatial heterogeneity of basement structures is an important factor in the north-south structural zonation and east-west structural segmentation of the Kuqa Depression, as well as an important inducing factor for the formation of local piercement salt structures.

On this basis, the influence of several possible factors on the formation and evolution of piercement structures is discussed through discrete element numerical simulation experiments. The results show that the salt piercement structures in the Kuqa Depression are mainly developed in the northern margin of the Wensu Uplift, the Quele passive salt diapir, and at the top of pre-existing basement faults in the Kelasu area. Salt rocks can directly pierce the overlying strata or contact the surrounding rocks through faulting. Growth strata characteristics indicate that the piercement structures in the Kelasu area formed earlier, followed by those in the northern Wensu margin, with the Quele piercement structures forming latest. The evolution of piercement structures can be divided into three stages: stable, weak compression, and strong compression. In a compressive environment, it is difficult for salt layers to form piercement structures relying solely on compressive stress. The edges of uplifts, early passive salt diapirs, the tops of pre-existing basement faults, and the fronts of sedimentary wedges are preferential locations for the development of piercement structures. The confinement of paleo-uplifts, reactivation of basement faults, preferential activity of early passive salt domes, and the progradation of the orogenic belt towards the basin interior are important inducing factors for the development of piercement structures. The crucial way these factors induce piercement structures is by promoting strong thrusting in suprasalt strata, thereby providing channels for salt upwelling.(Yang et al.,2024)。\n[Yang, K., Qi, J., Shen, F., Sun, T., Duan, Z., Cui, M., ... \u0026amp; Lv, J.

Abstract The thin-skinned fold-and-thrust belt with multiple detachments in the eastern Sichuan Basin is characterized by a series of fault-detachment folds with a backward preferred structural vergence, which is rare in nature and can’t be explained well by the classic critically taper theory. Here, three discrete element simulations were conducted to study the influence of multiple detachments on the structural vergence and evolution of the eastern Sichuan thin-skinned fold and thrust belt. The experimental results reveal that multiple detachment layers affected the bulk mechanical strength and facilitated a dually vergent thrust wedge with a backward preferred structural vergence. The addition of intermediate detachment layers influences structural vergence and fault activity of thrust wedges. With the increase in intermediate weak layers, the preferred structural vergence of these model results progressively moved from forward to nearly symmetric and eventually to backward. These results exhibit first-order structural similarities to the structural vergence and fault activity in the eastern Sichuan fold and thrust belt, which indicates that the influence of the internal distribution of weak layers within the eastern Sichuan Basin should not be ignored. The limited Cambrian evaporite layer and the widespread Silurian shale and Lower-Middle Triassic evaporite layers had significant impacts on the deformation of the fold-and-thrust belt in the eastern Sichuan basin. Consequently, we propose a kinematic model for the coupled geodynamic processes of the eastern Sichuan fold-and-thrust belt. The framework of the eastern Sichuan Basin with a number of backward fault-detachment folds was formed by Mesozoic northwestward propagation, and Cenozoic eastward propagation reactivated the folding and thrusting.

The discrete-element modeling (DEM) method was used to study the influences of the various mechanical properties of the detachments and syn-tectonic erosion/deposition on the structural evolution of the Longmen Shan and WSFB. DEM simulations demonstrated two stages of surface processes during the Late Cenozoic profoundly influenced thrusting sequences and strain localization in the hinterland and foreland portions of the Longmen Shan. Models indicate that the fold-and-thrust belt lacking surface processes propagate in a forward-breaking manner, whereas those with surface processes develop following an out-of-sequence thrusting pattern. We infer that large-scale erosion propagation from the Sichuan Basin westward to the Tibetan Plateau since Late Cenozoic caused the Longmen Shan hinterland to reach a subcritical wedge state. Tectonic activity retreats to the edge of Plateau, enhancing the rapid uplift of the Longmen Shan and inhibiting the propagation of substantial shortening deformation to the foreland basin. The foreland thrust belt slides stably along the shallow detachment, causing the initiation and growth of the Longquan fault in the leading front. These results explain why both the Longmen Shan hinterland and the western Sichuan foreland thrust belts are currently in a state of simultaneous seismic activity. Our findings offer important implications regarding the seismic potentials of other fold-and-thrust belts that interact with dynamic surface processes.\n     Figure 1.

Compared to traditional sandbox experiments, DEM allows for more precise control of experimental boundary conditions and quantitative analysis of the tectonic deformation process. This facilitates a deeper understanding of the influence of stratigraphic mechanical properties on tectonic deformation at the mesoscopic scale. This paper systematically elaborates on the quantitative analysis method for tectonic deformation based on DEM. Through a typical numerical simulation experiment of compressional tectonics using DEM, we modeled the formation process of tectonic structures under horizontal compression. The study analyzed the changes in stress and strain distribution, as well as the patterns of fracture generation during deformation, yielding the following insights:(1) The simulated tectonics are dominated by foreland-style imbricate thrust faults, with fault activity propagating sequentially from the compression end to regions farther away;(2) Fractures are closely related to fault formation, with the accumulation of numerous fractures in local areas acting as a trigger for fault development;(3) In the early stages of fault formation, material displacement within the fault is minimal, and the incremental increase in fractures is at its peak; in the later stages of fault activity, the incremental increase in fractures decreases;(4) Volumetric strain can characterize fracture types (tensile or compressive), while deformation strain can distinguish between forward and reverse thrust faults;(5) The magnitude of average stress is positively correlated with topographic relief, and the maximum shear stress continuously accumulates at the site of an impending new fault until the fault forms, after which the maximum shear stress dissipates, propagates forward, and accumulates at the next site of an impending fault. These findings demonstrate the significant potential of DEM in the quantitative study of tectonic deformation, stress-strain relationships, and fracture prediction.\n    (a) Principal Stress Difference and Axial Strain;(b) Shear Strength Envelope Figure 2: Biaxial Experiment Results   Figure 3: Initial Model   Figure 4: Structural Interpretation of the Wedge at Model Contraction of 1 km (a), 4 km (b), 9 km (c), 16 km (d), and 20 km (e)   Figure 6: Bonded Force Chain Distribution at Contraction of 1 km (a), 4 km (b), 9 km (c), 16 km (d), and 20 km (e) (Blue represents bonded force chains, yellow represents unbonded contacts)   Figure 8: Fault Slip Curves as a Function of Contraction (Faults F1, F2, F3, and F4 as shown in Figure 4; fault slip values measured from the green layer)   In Figure (a), four points are selected from four particles within faults F1, F2, F3, and F4 in the green marker layer.

It has two detachment layers, namely the Middle Jurassic Xishanyao Formation and the Lower Jurassic Badawan Formation. To explore the effects of the cohesion strength differences between these two detachment layers and the influence of pre-existing structures on the Cenozoic structural deformation of the thrust belt, this study employed discrete element numerical simulation methods. A total of five numerical simulation experiments were designed, including a model without detachment layers and models with double detachment layers of different cohesion strength combinations, all of which were set up with pre-existing structures. The results show that when the cohesion strengths of the two detachment layers are the same, the upper detachment layer dominates in stress propagation. When the cohesion strengths of the two detachment layers are different, stress tends to propagate along the weaker cohesion detachment layer. Moreover, when the cohesion strength of the lower detachment layer is weaker, the upper detachment layer may not function. By comparing the experimental results with the actual geological cross-sections, it is concluded that pre-existing structures control the overall pattern of structural deformation in the thrust belt, while the two detachment layers together control the decoupling of deformation in the vertical direction of the thrust belt. The cohesion strength of the upper detachment layer being weaker than that of the lower detachment layer is the key factor affecting the Cenozoic structural deformation in the study area.\n    Figure 1 Simplified Geological Structure Diagram of the Western Segment of Bogda Mountain   Figure 2 Typical Cross-Section Diagram of the Study Area   Figure 3 Initial Model Design   Figure 4 Simulation Results and Volume Strain Comparison  Acknowledgements The numerical calculations for this paper were completed on the computing cluster at the High-Performance Computing Center of Nanjing University.

Uniaxial compression test results and dipole acoustic logging data illustrate that the lower Paleozoic mechanical profile in the Shunbei region consists of 2 incompetent layers (middle Cambrian and Upper Ordovician) and 3 competent layers (Sinian–lower Cambrian, upper Cambrian–Middle Ordovician, and Silurian). Borehole and high-resolution 3D seismic data illustrate that the 3 competent layers are characterized by low-amplitude folds and isolated brittle faults. The discrete element method (DEM) modeling results indicate that mechanical stratigraphy is an important factor controlling the softlinked faulting style that is independent of multiphase deformation. A pre-existing structure promotes the formation of narrow and localized fault zones. The early–middle Silurian evolution of the Shunbei No. 1 fault zone reflects a classic stratigraphically decoupled deformation model: the middle fault arrays (upper Cambrian–Middle Ordovician layers) and en echelon normal faults (Silurian layer) synchronously experienced leftlateral slip. These two styles of faulting have different geometries (fault dips, slips, and arrangements) but are kinematically coupled and genetically related. This proposed deformation model provides mechanical support to document deeply buried structures by characterizing genetically related shallow structures, which may be widely employed as multiphase inheritance structures with mechanical stratigraphy. We also point out that vertical fault connectivity is a key research aspect of hydrocarbon exploration in the Shunbei oilfield.\n    Caption: Distribution map of (a) the structural elements in the Paleozoic tectonostratigraphic unit and intracratonic small-displacement (   Caption: Interpreted seismic cross-sections and related mechanical profiles (see Fig. 1a for location). a) W–E-oriented cross-section showing the pop-up structure of the Shunbei No. 5 fault zone (C–C\u0026#39;); b) W–E-oriented cross-section showing the pull-apart structure of the Shunbei No. 5 fault zone (D–D\u0026#39;); c) NW–SE-oriented cross-section showing the Shunbei No. 1 fault zone (E–E\u0026#39;).

Study on the Control Factors of Structural Deformation in the Southwestern Tianshan Piedmont Thrust Belt: Based on Discrete Element Numerical Simulation. Master’s Thesis. Zhejiang University.\nTitle: Study on the Control Factors of Structural Deformation in the Southwestern Tianshan Piedmont Thrust Belt: Based on Discrete Element Numerical Simulation Author:Wen Xin Abstract The deformation of the eastern and western segments of the fold-thrust belt in the southwestern Tianshan Piedmont is significantly different. The Kashgar northern margin thrust belt in the western segment is characterized by the development of “stacked” structures and basement-involved thrust structures, while the adjacent Kalpin thrust belt in the eastern segment develops large-scale imbricate thin-skinned detachment structures. What factors control the deformation differences in the thrust belt? Based on seismic interpretation profiles, this thesis uses discrete element numerical simulation to analyze the influence of single-variable controlling factors on the deformation of the thrust belt. A total of 28 experiments were designed to investigate the effects of factors such as detachment layer strength, detachment layer position, caprock thickness, pre-existing faults, single and bidirectional compression, and bidirectional compression distance on the structural deformation of the fold-thrust belt in the southwestern Tianshan Piedmont. The following conclusions were drawn based on the experimental results:\n1.The magnitude of the detachment layer’s cohesion plays an important controlling role in deformation. The cohesion of the detachment layer controls the ease with which faults beneath it can propagate upward. When the detachment layer has strong cohesion, it is easy for faults to break through the detachment layer along pre-existing weak zones, forming thrust nappe structures. When the detachment layer has weak cohesion, it will develop into a roof fault of the thrust system, hindering the upward propagation of pre-existing faults activated in the units below the detachment layer. A weak cohesion detachment layer can promote the deformation front to propagate faster and farther; it limits deformation to mainly occur in the units above the detachment layer, where triangular zones and pop-up structures are easily formed, and structural deformation in the units below the detachment layer is relatively weak. The smaller the cohesion of the detachment layer, the easier it is to form imbricate thin-skinned detachment structures; the thicker the overlying strata, the larger the scale and fewer the number of thrust sheets formed, and the greater the spacing between thrust sheets. 2.During single and bidirectional compression, stress and strain are mainly concentrated in weak zones such as detachment layers and faults, with stronger stress and strain near the compression end. The smaller the cohesion of the detachment layer, the easier it is for stress to propagate to distant locations. During close-range bidirectional compression, stress can propagate to the far end through the weak cohesion detachment layer, thereby affecting deformation at the far end. During long-range bidirectional compression, it does not affect deformation on the other side. 3.The Upper Cretaceous-Paleogene gypsum-salt detachment layer and pre-existing faults before the Cenozoic are the main controlling factors for the development of stacked deformation in the Kashgar northern margin thrust belt. At the same time, the northward compression of the Pamir arc tectonic belt has also affected the deformation style of the Kashgar northern margin thrust belt. The Paleogene gypsum-salt layer can serve as an effective detachment layer in the region. During compression, pre-existing faults from the pre-Cenozoic are successively activated and overlap to form a series of thrust sheets. The Upper Cretaceous-Paleogene gypsum-salt detachment layer acts as a roof fault, hindering the continued upward and southward propagation of deep faults beneath it, and forming “stacked” structures near the compression end. The Kashgar northern margin thrust belt is located in the Pamir and South Tianshan suture zone. Its southern front fault is affected by the northward thrusting of the Pamir arc tectonic belt, hindering the southward and upward breakthrough of the hidden thrust fault at the front edge of the Kashgar northern margin thrust belt. As a result, the Kashgar northern margin thrust belt does not form imbricate thin-skinned detachment structures similar to those in the Kalpin thrust belt. 4.The development of large-scale imbricate thin-skinned detachment structures in the Kalpin thrust belt is closely related to the Middle Cambrian gypsum-salt detachment layer and the thick Paleozoic sedimentary caprock. The development of thick Paleozoic and Cenozoic strata in the Kalpin area enhances the effectiveness of the Middle Cambrian gypsum-salt detachment layer as …","date":1647302400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647302400,"objectID":"8180507f0e69b985253ee3ae9abca13a","permalink":"https://geovbox.com/en/blog/20230315/","publishdate":"2022-03-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/blog/20230315/","section":"blog","summary":"Paper Download： Wen Xin (2021).

It is an indispensable tool for quantitative research on structural deformation.   Extract stratum boundaries    Identify salt layer extent    Plot stress-strain \nAbstract The discrete element method (DEM) is a numerical simulation technique that uses a microscopic particle system to simulate the deformation of macroscopic objects. It is widely applied in fields such as geotechnical engineering, structural simulation, and material transport. As an important means of quantitative structural research, structural numerical simulation establishes a connection between deformation mechanisms and geometric analysis of structures, overcoming the limitations of traditional structural analysis methods in the study of salt-bearing fold-thrust belts to a certain extent. DEM numerical simulation can present structural deformation and track the force and motion states of particles at each moment during the simulation, providing information on the stress-strain state and velocity-displacement field of the system. This allows for the study of small-scale deformations and fractures, enabling quantitative research on salt-bearing fold-thrust structures with significant scientific and economic value. Therefore, efficiently expressing the distribution of dynamic and kinematic characteristics in structural simulations has important application value. Based on literature research, algorithm design and development, computational examples, and structural numerical simulation experiments, this paper has completed the following work:\n1.The literature review discusses the importance of multi-dimensional post-processing analysis for structural simulation: while structural deformation reflects the overall shape of the structure, the distribution of strain can reflect small-scale structural deformation in the model, the distribution of velocity fields can reveal the motion states of different structural units, and displacement gradients can provide a more detailed view of fracture distribution. 2.Designed and developed a post-processing calculation and visualization analysis module DEMpost adapted to the discrete element software YADE. The particle system is presented in the form of images through a rasterization algorithm, and the stress-strain and other characteristics of the particle system are presented in the form of images through an inverse distance weighted interpolation algorithm. The quality of these images is improved through other image processing algorithms. An association can be established between the structural deformation images in image form and the characteristic maps, facilitating the tracking of dynamic and kinematic characteristics of specific structural units during structural evolution. 3.Designed systematic discrete element numerical simulation experiments, analyzed the influence of common factors in salt-bearing fold-thrust belt structures, realized post-processing visualization of structural simulation based on DEMpost, and explored the mapping relationship between structural deformation and dynamic and kinematic characteristics. The simulation results show that the presence of a single gypsum-salt layer at the bottom causes stress-strain to rapidly propagate to the structural boundary, resulting in contraction and extrusion within the entire model and the development of a “box-like” structure; the presence of double gypsum-salt layers transforms rigid uplift associated with conjugate faults into a rheological fold structure, with stable stress-strain states within the gypsum-salt layers, and their influence on the structure is manifested as strain dispersion and triangular shear zones with a certain radiation range; pre-existing faults promote upward movement of the hanging wall along the fault, and factors such as the dip direction, dip angle, and scale of pre-existing faults affect the direction and distance of hanging wall movement, which in turn affects the range of deformation propagation.\nKeywords: discrete element method; post-processing; rasterization; spatial interpolation; image processing; structural numerical …","date":1635638400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635638400,"objectID":"2879cc92ebe734ccbf12bdaabb62797e","permalink":"https://geovbox.com/en/blog/20221031/","publishdate":"2021-10-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/blog/20221031/","section":"blog","summary":"Recently, we will invite Wei Huajing, a master’s student from Nanjing University, to present his research findings on discrete element post-processing, DEMpost.

Kuqa Depression has a well-preserved thin-skinned fold-and-thrust system with the salt layer as the décollement. To investigate the effects of salt thickness on the structural deformation in the Kuqa Depression, three discrete element models with different salt thicknesses were constructed. The experiment without salt was controlled by several basal décollement dominant faults, forming several imbricate sheets. The experiments with salt developed the decoupled deformation with the salt layer as the upper décollement (subsalt, intrasalt, and suprasalt), significantly similar to the Kuqa Depression along the northern margin of Tarim Basin. Basal décollement dominant imbricated thrusts formed at the subsalt units, while the monoclinal structure formed at the suprasalt units. The decoupled deformation was also observed in the tectonic deformation graphics, distortional strain fields, and max shear stress fields. However, the salt layer was thickened in the thick salt model, and the salt thickness of the thin salt model varied slightly because the thin salt weakened the flowability of the salt. The lower max shear stress zone was easily formed in the distribution region of salt under the action of compression stress, which is conducive to the flow convergence of salt and the crumpled deformation of interlayer in salt. The results are well consistent with the natural characteristics of structural deformation in the Kuqa Depression. Our modeling result concerns the structural characteristics and evolution of salt-related structures and the effects of salt thickness on the structural deformation in the compressional stress field, which might be helpful for the investigations of salt-related structures in other salt-bearing fold-and-thrust belts.\n    FIGURE 5.

The thickness, density, and distribution of the detachment layer significantly affect the propagation and distribution of stress and strain. In terms of horizontal propagation, the detachment layer makes it easier for stress and strain to propagate. Vertically, the detachment layer is a key factor in the vertical stratification of deformation, with distinct structural deformation patterns above and below the detachment layer. The presence of double detachment layers accelerates the propagation speed of stress and strain and also affects the maximum propagation distance. The complex structures in the Majiaba area of the Longmen Shan Fault in Sichuan may be influenced by double detachment layers, driven by two phases of tectonic geological movements: gravitational detachment and regional horizontal compression. VBOX software can be effectively used to simulate fold-thrust structural deformation, and the simulation results show a good agreement with actual geological structures. Additionally, VBOX software is equipped with various basic model data, along with its open multi-port design and efficient parallel computing design, demonstrating good potential in tectonic geological simulation. With continuous updates in computing hardware and software facilities, tectonic numerical simulation will have broader development prospects.

This method aids in revealing the deformation characteristics and mechanisms of fold-thrust belts, as well as evaluating the influence of stress-strain distribution on the physical properties of hydrocarbon reservoirs, demonstrating significant theoretical and practical value.Building upon literature review, field geological investigations, seismic profile interpretation, and analog tectonic modeling, this study employs DEM-based numerical simulations to comprehensively analyze the structural deformation features, evolutionary mechanisms, and controlling factors of fold-thrust belts. The main findings include:\n A structured array was employed to construct the fundamental data architecture of the Discrete Element Method (DEM). The grid-based neighbor search algorithm was optimized to accelerate neighbor detection and contact evaluation. By reorganizing the modules for neighbor search, contact judgment, and contact force updates, a lock-free and high-efficiency parallel computing framework was achieved. The linear elastic and Hertz-Mindlin contact mechanics models were integrated to develop VBOX, a highly scalable and high-performance DEM program tailored for tectonic simulations, along with a standardized testing protocol. The concepts of equivalent parameters and equivalent models were introduced. Through angle-of-repose and biaxial tests, the mesoscopic parameters of quartz sand particles reflecting macroscopic mechanical properties were calibrated. A comparative study between physical analog modeling and DEM numerical simulation was designed, proposing a grid-based quantitative analysis method for thrust wedges. Key geometric parameters (e.g., slope angle, fault dip) were systematically compared to evaluate the similarities and differences between these two approaches in studying tectonic deformation. A comprehensive correspondence table between particle-scale mesoscopic parameters and rock macroscopic properties was established via systematic DEM simulations. The controlling effects of stratigraphic cohesion, internal friction angle, décollement strength, and thickness on fold-thrust belt evolution were investigated. Quantitative analysis of deformation characteristics and mechanisms provided foundational support for advancing theories of complex fold-thrust systems. Low-cohesion strata exhibit dispersed strain distribution with random fracture networks, while high-cohesion strata develop localized strain with larger fault displacements and potential back-thrusts. Weakly cohesive rocks with diffuse fractures form porous reservoirs favorable for hydrocarbon storage, whereas strongly cohesive rocks develop fracture corridors serving as preferential migration pathways. Décollement strength predominantly controls structural style: high-friction décollements produce forward-propagating imbricate thrusts, whereas low-friction décollements generate pop-up structures with alternating fore- and back-thrusts. Stratigraphic competence shows minor influence, with overall deformation mainly governed by basal décollement strength. Décollement thickness exhibits negligible impact on structural patterns. Focusing on the Cenozoic Kuqa fold-thrust belt, mesoscopic parameters corresponding to rock salt macro-properties were calibrated. Numerical simulations demonstrated that syn-tectonic sedimentation critically controls deformation partitioning, revealing its key role in the Qiulitag salt diapir evolution. Salt produces vertically stratified deformation: sub-salt structures feature closely spaced thrust faults, while supra-salt domains develop broad folds. Initial salt basin width was identified as the primary factor controlling along-strike structural variability in western Kuqa. Lateral segmentation of deformation results from variations in initial salt basin width and thickness. Stress stratification divides the section into three domains: maximum stress below salt, minimum stress within salt, and intermediate stress above salt. Salt flow exhibits directional preference, with layer-parallel movement enhanced by syn-tectonic sedimentation, showing overall flow direction consistent with compression.

The interior characteristics of faults in the southern and central LMS fold-thrust belt were also evaluated during the interaction of tectonic processes and surface processes according to the stress-strain analysis from DEM results. The results showed that synkinematic erosion promoted the reactivation of pre-existing faults in thrust wedges and also retarded the formation and development of new incipient faults in the pre-wedge regions. Meanwhile, synkinematic sedimentation also delayed the development of new incipient faults in the pre-wedge regions by promoting the development of thrust faults in the front of thrust wedges, causing these thrust wedges in supercritical stages with relatively narrow wedge lengths. According to these DEM results, we infer that: 1) The characteristics of erosion and sedimentation in the central and southern LMS have important influences on the activities of large faults which are extended into the deep detachment layer; 2) Besides differential erosion, the differential sedimentary loading may also be one of the important factors for the along-strike differential evolution of the LMS fold-thrust belt. This kind of differential deposition may lead to differential fault activity and uplift in the interior thrust wedge and pre-wedge region in the central and southern LMS; 3) Compared to the northern LMS, the central LMS and southern LMS is more conducive to the occurrence of earthquakes, because of synkinematic sedimentation (such as the growth of Chengdu plain) has a greater blocking effect on the stress propagation and strain convergence on the fault planes of front faults of an active thrust wedge.\n    FIGURE 1 | Regional map of the LMS fold-thrust belt (A) and its geological structure map (B) (modified from [(Sun et al.,2016)](#refer-sun2016), Co-seismic rupture zones from [(Xu et al.,2009)](#refer-xu2009).

In this paper, based on structural profile interpretation, and using discrete element numerical simulation research and single factor variable control method, we have designed five sets of numerical simulation experiments to analyze the effect of controlling factors of structural evolution in the research area. We include the model of pre-existing fracture, the model of décollement and the comprehensive model of pre-existing fracture, and décollement with different cohesion. The experimental results show that the cohesion of the décollement controls the difficulty in the upward breakthrough of pre-existing faults. When the cohesion of the décollement is high, it is easy to form basement involved thrust structure along the pre-existing faults. When the cohesion of the décollement is low, the roof faults of thrust system develop in the décollement and the fault below the décollement is prevented from spreading upward. With the active pre-existing faults is easy to form thin skin imbricate structures. In the area where the low cohesion décollement is developed, the deformation front propagates faster and farther forward. The deformation primarily occurs in the upper unit and mainly contains the thrust structure and triangular belt, while the structural deformation of the lower unit is relatively weak. The “stacking” structure and basement involved thrust structure that are developed in the fold-thrust belts of the southwestern Tianshan were mainly controlled by the gypsum-salt layer of the Paleogene and the pre-existing faults of the pre-Cenozoic.\n    Fig.5 The initial model of the simulations   Fig.11 The numerical simulation results contrastof the different initial conditions model   Fig.12 The numerical simulation results contrastof the different cohesion decollement model Acknowledgments The simulation experiments in this study were conducted using the discrete element numerical simulation software VBOX, independently developed by Changsheng Li from East China University of Technology.

The subsalt structure is composed of an imbricate thrusting belt in the Kelasu structure of the western segment, while it is a faulted anticline in the Dongqiu structure of the eastern segment. In this paper, based on seismic interpretation, five discrete element models are designed to explore the influence of pre-existing faults, syntectonic sedimentation and properties of salt layer on the structural geometry and evolution of fold-and-thrust belts, as well as the causes behind the different structural features of the eastern and western segments in the Kuqa depression. The simulation results show that the deformations of units above and below the salt layer are decoupled. A pre-existing fault can affect the deformation propagation, causing the differences in subsalt wedge shape, fault numbers and suprasalt structural geometry. Syntectonic sedimentation could enhance the deformation decorrelation above and below the salt layer, while a stronger salt property decreases it. Comparing the simulation results with the structural features of the eastern and western segments in the Kuqa depression, we suggest that a pre-existing fault could be the controlling factor of the structural variations between eastern and western segments. In the eastern Kuqa depression, the location of pre-existing fault first deforms, forming the Dongqiu fault and the Dongqiu anticline above it. Besides, the pre-existing fault absorbs most of the shortening, and prevents the deformation from propagating forward, thus causing an out of sequence deformation propagation. In the western Kuqa depression, with no interruption from pre-existing fault, the deformation of subsalt units sequentially propagates forward and forms an imbricate thrusting belt.\n    Fig.13 Deformation and distortional strain field for five models at the shortening of 11km.

Rapid uplift with accelerated erosion and two sets of detachments in the Lower Triassic and Lower Cambrian controlled the multilevel deformation structure. We conducted discrete numerical simulations with double weak detachments and erosion under extrusion conditions in order to examine the mechanics and kinematics of the frontal piedmont zones of the NW Sichuan Basin. The following findings were made. (1) With continuous compression, the weak detachments promoted the decoupled and ladder-like deformation of the thrust belt, where the deformation above the slip layer extended further than it did below it. Rapid uplift and erosion at the thrust front contributed to the formation of a passive roof fault and a monocline in the upper layer, a series of forward and backward thin-skinned thrust-buried structures in the middle layer sandwiched between two weak detachments and stacking structures in the lower layer. (2) Erosion effectively prevents the deformation from propagating above the upper detachment, but can advance a horizontal transition in the deformation style generated within the middle brittle layer: from oblique and tight fault propagation folds to symmetrical, wide, and gentle detachment folds. (3) The model results consistent with tectonic deformation in the NW Sichuan Basin indicate a possible evolutionary mechanism under compression. There is hierarchical deformation of uncoordinated contraction controlled by the Lower Triassic and Early Cambrian weak layers, with the characteristics of the shallow monocline, the middle thin-skinned thrusts, and the deeper basement-involved folds. Continuous compression contributed a sequential pattern of steps as a whole, from the frontal piedmont zones to the foreland basin, autochthonous stacking thrusts, and the huge buried structure in the NW Sichuan Basin. During the Himalayan period, syntectonic erosion along with the uplifted thrust front maintained the development of a passive-roof duplex and a huge forward buried structure.\n    Modeled progress with two detachments due to the left-wall displacement    Modeled progress with two detachments and erosions due to the left-wall displacement   Comparison of the slope angle versus shortening for the two models ","date":1616976000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616976000,"objectID":"4cea0e37b446dcabd32e880ac1c0fd20","permalink":"https://geovbox.com/en/blog/20210329/","publishdate":"2021-03-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/blog/20210329/","section":"blog","summary":"Xu, W., Yin, H., Jia, D., Li, C., Wang, W., Yang, G., He, W., Chen, Z., Ren, R., 2021.

Abstract\nNumerical simulation, along with theoretical analysis and scientific experiments, forms one of the three pillars of modern scientific research. In the field of tectonic geology, numerical simulation has become an important tool ranging from the dynamics of supercontinent rifting to the geometric and kinematic studies of basin tectonic deformation.\nIn recent years, with the development of discrete element theory and computer technology, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) (Cundall and Strack, 1979) has been widely applied to tectonic simulations at different scales. Compared to traditional sandbox modeling methods, discrete element methods can more precisely control experimental boundary conditions and quantitatively analyze tectonic deformation processes, aiding in a deeper understanding of the mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms at the micro-scale. The discrete element method employs discrete particles to represent rocks that conform to real physical and mechanical properties, effectively analyzing problems with numerous discontinuities. Since the 1990s, DEM has been widely used to address tectonically related geological issues.

Session 14: Tectonic Evolution of Orogenic Belts—Longmenshan  Report 1: Analysis of the Longmenshan Reverse Thrust Belt Structure by Professor Yan Danping, China University of Geosciences (Beijing) Report 2: Cenozoic Tectonic Deformation and Simulation of the Longmenshan  Presenter: Wang Maomao, School of Marine Science, Hohai University Content Summary:  Eastern Tibetan Plateau: Debate on Lower Crustal Flow vs. Upper Crustal Shortening; Cenozoic tectonic deformation of the Longmenshan fold-thrust belt; Research progress on the simulation of Cenozoic tectonic deformation.   The numerical simulations used in the report were completed using VBOX; The simulation results effectively explain the differential distribution of structural strain in the Cenozoic foreland thrust belt of Longmenshan; Experimental design and boundary condition control are worthy of study.    Tectonic physical modeling and numerical simulation can quantitatively analyze the deformation characteristics of fold-thrust belts through accurate boundary conditions and parameter settings. This is an important method for quantifying the deformation processes and mechanisms of fold-thrust belts. Compared to physical modeling, numerical simulation can obtain more information from within the system (such as stress and strain) and has higher reproducibility, with easier boundary condition settings (Li Changsheng, 2019). In the 1970s, Cundall and Strack (1979) proposed the Discrete Element Method (DEM) based on the mechanics of discontinuous media to study various mechanical behaviors of geotechnical materials. This method treats a granular assembly model as a collection of discrete elements, allowing for large displacements between particles, making it particularly suitable for tectonic deformation research and is one of the main directions for future studies on tectonic deformation (Morgan, 2015).\nAssociate Professor Wang Maomao will present his latest research findings titled “Cenozoic Tectonic Deformation and Simulation of the Longmenshan” in the Tectonic Network Forum. The numerical simulation part is completed using the discrete element numerical simulation software VBOX.\n  Poster  Acknowledgments The stress-strain analysis code is modified from the computing script provided by Professor Julia K. Morgan at Rice University; special thanks to her.\nReferences  [Li, Changsheng.

Restricting Movement In the Hertz contact model of discrete elements, the stiffness coefficient of contact is related to the overlap amount of particles. Thus, it needs to be updated at each time step. When calculating the contact stiffness coefficient, incorporating the following three lines of pseudocode and modifying the color of contact particles can simulate the infectious disease spread process.\n Red: Infectious source Blue: Susceptible particles that become infected upon contact with red  if ((spheres[index_o].color == red) || (spheres[index_a].color == red)) { spheres[index_o].color = red; spheres[index_a].color = red; }  Assumption: A closed space contains 200 healthy blue particles, all of which move automatically, and contact leads to infection with no chance of recovery. Boundary Condition: A particle numbered 0 suddenly becomes infected with the red virus, and 10% (20 particles) start moving and activate other particles. Simulation Results:  Infection gradually spreads from the first case outward; the closer to the red particle numbered 0, the faster the infection occurs. In the case of free movement without damping, only one particle survives. When free movement occurs with damping, the left half of the particles has not yet been infected.   Experiment 1 Damping=0.0    Experiment 2 Damping=0.2     2. Herd Immunity Professor Zhang from China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) suggested that 60% of the particles acquire immunity.\n Red: Infectious source Blue: Susceptible particles that become infected upon contact with red Green: Immune particles that are not infected by the red particles and do not transmit to others.  // Only if both are not green, consider mutual infection \tif ((spheres[index_o].color != green) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (spheres[index_a].color != green)) { if ((spheres[index_o].color == red) || (spheres[index_a].color == red)) { spheres[index_o].color = red; spheres[index_a].color = red; } }  Experiment 3: In a closed space, there are 200 healthy blue particles, (60%) 120 of which have acquired immunity as green particles. All particles move automatically, with blue particles becoming infected upon contact with red and permanently turning red. Boundary Condition: A particle numbered 0 suddenly becomes infected with the red virus; 10% (20 particles) start moving and activate other particles.

Its vertical structural features are distinct: the western depression belt is characterized by a graben-like fault system, with a predominant eastward dip and an average basin depth of approximately 3000 to 4000 meters, while the eastern depression belt exhibits a symmetric, multi-fault graben structure with depths reaching 7000 to 9000 meters. This study focuses on the Lishui depression in the western depression belt and the Xihu depression in the eastern depression belt as key research subjects. The representative seismic profiles reveal significant differences in structural characteristics between the two depressions: the faults in the Lishui depression are predominantly asymmetrical, with major faults inclined westward, whereas the Xihu depression displays a symmetrical double-fault graben structure. To further investigate the underlying reasons for the notable structural differences between the eastern and western segments of the East China Sea shelf basin, we employed a structural simulation approach.\nOver the past two decades, numerical simulation and quantitative analysis have advanced rapidly, transforming the study of extensional fault structures from purely qualitative research to quantitative analysis (Li Sanzhong et al., 2003). To examine the influence of the differences in substrate strength on the structural characteristics of the western and eastern depression belts of the East China Sea shelf basin, we conducted a series of discrete element numerical simulation experiments. The micro-parameters of the particles are detailed in Li Changsheng (2019). The left substrate was simulated as a rigid substrate, wherein the velocity discontinuity points (faults) would move with the blue substrate upon extension. The red substrate simulated a ductile substrate, composed of overlapping particles, while the cyan substrate remained fixed. Bonding points connected the cyan substrate and both the blue and red substrates. As the blue substrate moved to the right, the red ductile substrate was gradually extended to simulate the stretching effect of the ductile substrate.\n  Figure 1: Numerical Simulation Experiment  The experimental simulation results indicated that when the substrate is set as a rigid substrate (see Figure 1a), the structural characteristics of the depression exhibit asymmetrical half-graben features due to extensional forces, with dominant eastward-leaning bounding faults. The fault roots are situated at the velocity discontinuity points of the rigid substrate, leading to the sedimentary center being located on the west side of the depression. As a result, significantly more faults are developed on the eastern side of the depression compared to the western side, with the primary fault trend leaning westward (see Figure 1b, left side of the depression). Conversely, when the substrate is set as a ductile substrate (see Figure 1a), the structural characteristics of the depression demonstrate a symmetrical graben structure, where both roots of the double bounding faults reside within the ductile substrate. The faults within the depression are symmetrically distributed about the sedimentary center, with both sides having a similar number of faults exhibiting opposite inclinations (see Figure 1b, left side of the depression).\nConclusion The simulation results closely resemble the primary structural characteristics revealed in the seismic profiles of the study area, indicating that the differences in substrate strength significantly influence the tectonic evolution of the western depression belt (Lishui depression) and the eastern depression belt (Xihu depression) of the East China Sea shelf basin, leading to the distinct “east-west zonation” features observed in the region.\nAcknowledgments We thank Professor Julia K.

The study explored the inverted tectonic characteristics of the Maodong Fault Zone, as a faulted basin, under the current regional stress field and the mechanism of normal fault inversion for seismic control. The results indicate that:（1）Under compressive stress, tectonic inversion occurs in the faulted basin, which reactivates pre-existing normal faults and leads to the deformation of shallow strata, but the pre-existing faults in the basin generally maintain a normal fault shape；（2）During the process of tectonic inversion, stress-strain convergence is more likely to occur preferentially along the basal fault plane, gradually propagating into the sedimentary strata, ultimately triggering structural deformation at the shallow surface；（3）The Maodong Fault Zone is an active fault group, with the Maodong Fault and other boundary faults (basal faults) controlling basin activity. Along such faults, stress-strain convergence is evident, making them capable of generating medium to large earthquakes. Additionally, other concealed secondary pre-existing faults within the faulted basin may also have the potential for activity, with stress-strain convergence occurring in the strata between fault blocks under compressive-torsional stress fields, making them capable of generating shallow-source small earthquakes. Keywords: Faulted Basin; Discrete Element Simulation; Maodong Fault Zone; Tectonic Inversion; Fault Activity\nThe eastern part of China is influenced by the combined effects of the subduction of the Pacific Plate to the west and the subduction of the Philippine Plate to the northwest towards the Eurasian continent. The main characteristics of the modern tectonic stress field are expressed as compressive stress in the northeast-east to southwest-west direction (Figure 1a). Affected by the dextral strike-slip movement along the Tan-Lu Fault Zone and the dextral strike-slip movement along the southeastern coastal fault zones, the eastern part of the Lower Yangtze Block is mainly located in the compressive-torsional transition zone between these forces (Figure 1a). The modern tectonic stress field in the Lower Yangtze Block shows distinct compressive-torsional characteristics, leading to the development of both normal and reverse fault structures within the faulted basins of the region (Figure 1b).\n  Figure 1: Regional Location Map of the Study Area and Distribution of Historical Earthquakes  Maodong Faulted Basin Within the faulted basin (e.g., the Zhiqi Bridge Depression), high-angle faults are distributed, and these faults generally exhibit normal fault characteristics (Figure 2a). On the western side of the depression, the faults dip to the southeast (SEE); on the eastern side of the depression, the faults dip to the northwest (NWW) (Figure 2a). Previous studies along the Maodong Fault have conducted detailed geological surveys, resulting in representative surface geological profiles of the Maodong Faulted Basin (Figures 2b to 2d). These geological profiles indicate that along the Maodong Fault, the strata have undergone varying degrees of folding deformation. In addition, along the Maodong Fault, some Quaternary sedimentary strata in the faulted basin have been disrupted by faulting (Figure 2b) or have experienced co-tectonic deformation (Figure 2d), further demonstrating that the reverse faulting activity along the Maodong Fault has persisted into the Quaternary.\n  Figure 2: Exploration Profile of the Maodong Faulted Basin  Model Design The initial model for the discrete element simulation experiment in this study is shown in Figure 5. The model includes two types of basic particles representing rock grains, with radii set to 40 m and 60 m, respectively. All particles are randomly distributed within a closed square box, and they are allowed to settle and compact under the influence of gravity. In the experimental design, pre-existing normal faults (weakened faults) within the basin are defined, and the hanging wall and footwall of the faults are allowed to deform freely, so as to observe the deformation patterns of the hanging and footwalls during the compressive inversion process.

Its unique capacity to accommodate large interparticle displacements makes it particularly suited for modeling high-strain deformation, offering distinct advantages in addressing geological problems related to structural deformation.\nOur team presented the research The Influence of Detachment Zone Strength on Compressional Tectonics: A Discrete Element Modeling Approach at the 2017 Annual Meeting of the Chinese Geoscience Union (CGU) as a [poster\n  Initial model    When the extrusion capacity is 10km，Tectonic deformation and strain   Translator: Chi Yu\n","date":1509148800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509148800,"objectID":"e66cdf3e596f2ac0594ecbc15bfbe25c","permalink":"https://geovbox.com/en/blog/cgu2017/","publishdate":"2017-10-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/blog/cgu2017/","section":"blog","summary":"Location：Beijing\nTime：2017\nTopic：Effects of Detachment Layer Strength on Compressional Structures: Insights from Discrete Element Numerical Modeling\nDownload：[posters](Li Changsheng 2017 The Influence of Detachment Zone Strength on Contractional Tectonics-A Discrete Element Modeling Approach-CGU posters.","tags":null,"title":"2017 Annual Meeting of the Chinese Geoscience Union:The Influence of Detachment Layer Strength on Compressional Tectonics","type":"blog"},{"authors":["LiChangsheng"],"categories":["Software"],"content":" Download：VBOX Brief introduction\n VBOX (Virtual Sandbox) is a 2D Discrete Element Method (DEM) software platform specifically designed for tectonic deformation research.

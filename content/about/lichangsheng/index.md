You can follow me in the [github](https://github.com/LI-Chang-Sheng), I will update the funny DEM codes there. 

> My research interests reside in structural geology, discrete element model and analogue model, as well as high performance computing (OpenMP, GPU).


**Education**

08/2014-Present    Ph.D. in Structural Geology, School of Earth Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing University, China


> I used discrete element model (DEM) and analogue model (AM) experiment to quantify and simulate the evolution of thrust wedge. Quantitative field data and laboratory data are combined with computer modeling, to help  establish robust features of tectonic models on the scale of the upper crust. Recently, I am working on a parallel Discrete Element Model based on CPU/GPU._


09/2012-06/2014 M.S. in Geological Engineering, School of Earth Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing University, China

> I investigated the characteristics of deformation, stress field and failure of soil–rock mixture by using numerical simulation and triaxial test with computed tomography (CT) scan._

09/2008-07/2012   B.S. in Geological Engineering, North China Institute of Science and Technology, China

Discrete element numerical simulation is an important method for studying the process and mechanisms of tectonic deformation, particularly suited for investigating geological issues related to tectonic deformation.
VBOX uses a mature contact mechanics model and is equipped with comprehensive software manuals and structural simulation examples. It significantly outperforms other discrete element numerical simulation software （such as[PFC2D](https://www.itascacg.com/software/pfc)，[YADE](https://yade-dev.gitlab.io/trunk/)）。 Furthermore, researchers with no programming background can also master VBOX in a short period of time.

- The related calculations can be completed within a day
- Rich structural simulations[instance](/gallery/)
- Log in to the High-Performance Computing Center of Nanjing University [http://hpcc.nju.edu.cn](http://hpcc.nju.edu.cn)，It is ready to use.


We will present the topic **The Impact of Co-Tectonic Sedimentation on the Salt Structure Deformation Evolution and Stress-Strain Distribution in the Kuqa Depression** at the 2nd "Young Scholars Forum on Tectonic Geology and Geodynamics," held from March 29 to April 3, 2019.

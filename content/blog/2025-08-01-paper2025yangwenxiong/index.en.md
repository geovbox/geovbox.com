#### Abstract
The theory of thrust-related folding has significantly enhanced our comprehension of the kinematic evolution of folds, especially those associated with fault ramps. Despite extensive research into the deformation mechanisms of the fore-limb in the hanging wall folds, the factors influencing back-limb deformation remain relatively underexplored. This study employs a series of discrete-element simulations to investigate the evolution of ramp related folding, particularly focusing on the factors governing the development of back-thrusts. Comparative analyses reveal diverse deformation styles within the hanging wall of a ramp fold. Notably, when the upper layer exhibits significantly greater strength relative to the lower layer, and an intermediate décollement exists between them, decoupled deformation occurs, characterized by back-thrusting predominantly in the lower layer. This phenomenon is analogous to the deep thrust belts beneath the Shizigou anticline in the western Qaidam Basin, northern Tibetan Plateau, where multiple hydrocarbon-bearing layers have been identified. The findings offer significant insights into the mechanisms of thrust-related folding, thereby improving efficient hydrocarbon exploration in relevant regions. Furthermore, unlike the commonly reported nucleation of a fault ramp from the basal d ́ecollement or at an intermediate level, our observations indicate initiation from the shallow section. The detailed mechanism underlying such differential deformation warrant further investigation.

### Conclusions

The results of our discrete-element numerical simulations concerning the back-limb deformation during ramp folding lead to the following conclusions.
(1) The vertical heterogeneity in stratal strength under ramp folding has a significant influence on the development of back-thrusts. When the upper and lower layers exhibit uniform mechanical properties, a through-going fault is more likely to develop along the axial plane of the fold. Conversely, when there is a disparity in mechanical properties, deformation tends to be more diffuse within the weaker layer.
(2) The friction coefficient of the ramp governs the deformation intensity of the hanging wall. A lower ramp friction promotes reactivation of the ramp and facilitates strain propagation along it, leading to folding of the overlying strata and associated fault development. Conversely, higher friction coefficients suppress ramp reactivation, concentrating deformation predominantly in the hinterland region and limiting strain propagation to the ramp position during later stages of evolution.
(3) When an intermediate d ́ecollement exists between the upper and lower layers, decoupled deformation results in distinctly different structural styles. Back-thrusting is more localized in strata with uniform strength distribution. In cases where the upper layer exhibits significantly greater strength relative to the lower layer, back-thrusting is confined to the region beneath the intermediate detachment layer. These modelled tectonic characteristics align with the patterns observed in natural examples from the western Qaidam Basin, particularly where back-thrusting associated with the deep fault F2 is confined to the area beneath the Shizigou thrust fault, which developed along the salt layer at the top of the E32 formation.

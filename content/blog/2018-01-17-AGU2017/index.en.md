The discrete element method has various stringent assumptions. *Can it simulate construction? Can it replicate real physical events in the laboratory? *These are the questions that concern us in this meeting.
The team presented the paper "Comparison of Discrete Element Numerical Simulation and Physical Simulation" at the American Geophysical Union 2017 Fall Meeting, held from December 10-16, 2017.

We participated in the American Geophysical Union (AGU) 2017 Fall Meeting with the presentation titled **Comparison of Discrete Element Numerical Simulation and Physical Simulation**.

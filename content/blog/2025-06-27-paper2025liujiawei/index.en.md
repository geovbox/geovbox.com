#### Abstract
Investigating the multi-stage tectonic evolution of fold-and-thrust belts (FTBs) remains a significant challenge. In particular, the evolution of its internal structures and the mechanisms that govern deformation propagation require further research. This study focuses on the Ziliujing anticline located in the southwestern Sichuan Basin, China. It provides an in-depth analysis of the structural development and evolution of the frontal zone of the SW Sichuan FTB, which has propagated from the southeast to the northwest. Through detailed interpretation of seismic reflection profiles and quantitative area-depth-strain (ADS) analysis, we have identified three distinct stages of tectonic shortening corresponding to the Caledonian, Indosinian, and Yanshan-Himalayan orogenic periods. These findings are consistent with the established history of regional tectonic evolution. Furthermore, discrete-element numerical simulations demonstrate that the pinch-out of the basal décollement exerts a significant influence fault development and the formation of overlying fold patterns during multi-stage tectonic deformation. During the initial phase, deformation progressively propagates forward until it reaches the tip of the décollement, where subsequent deformation becomes predominantly localized. The decoupling effect induced by the intermediate décollement facilitates the continued forward propagation of underlying deformation. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the multi-stage compressional deformation of salt-bearing fold-thrust belts and the critical factors governing the propagation of deformation from mountain ranges to basins.

### Conclusions

By integrating structural analysis of seismic reflection profiles with numerical simulations, we have drawn the following conclusions.
(1) Our ADS analysis confirms that the Ziliujing anticline, as a superimposed structure, has experienced multi-stage tectonic shortening during the Caledonian, Indosinian, and Yanshan-Himalayan orogenic periods.
(2) The presence of the Middle-Lower Cambrian detachment layer, composed primarily of gypsum and salt, facilitated the northwestward propagation of compressional deformation originating from the SE Sichuan FTB during the Caledonian period. This deformation rapidly reached its leading edge in the Ziliujing anticline.
(3) The development of the Ziliujing anticline is predominantly influenced by the pinch-out of the Cambrian salt detachment. Detailed  structural analysis indicates a sequential evolution of internal structures at the deformation front. Upon reaching the pinch-out, subsequent deformation tends to localize there.

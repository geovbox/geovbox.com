After nearly half a month of meticulous production (2020/02/18–2020/02/29), the beginner's video tutorial for ZDEM is finally online today!

This video tutorial is approximately 2 hours long and is designed for users with no prior experience. Upon completing the tutorial, you will be able to use VBOX for structural numerical simulations.
The VBOX command scripts follow the standards of the particle discrete element numerical simulation software *PFC4.0*, allowing PFC4.0 users to get started directly without additional learning.

> The video tutorial is published on **geovbox@Bilibili**. For details, see [Beginner's Tutorial on Discrete Element Numerical Simulation Software ZDEM (DEM)](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av91259173/).。

### CCF HPC China Introduction to the 8th Forum on Domestic Application Software 2021

Industrial software represents a core and crucial technology for China's transition from a manufacturing powerhouse to a design powerhouse. Achieving independent innovation breakthroughs in high-end fields such as research and development, and enabling China's industrial enterprise software system to become autonomous and controllable have become key focuses of national attention. With the support of national major science and technology projects and relevant industrial policies, and against the backdrop of the international environment, domestic application software in the HPC field has developed rapidly. A complete domestic industrial software product system has now been formed, providing a strong guarantee for the development of domestic industrial software.

This forum invites key developers of domestic application software to jointly discuss the current status, development bottlenecks, required support, market promotion strategies, and future development trends of domestic application software. It is hoped that China's domestic application software can continue to develop steadily with the support of multiple parties and occupy a place in the mainstream international market.

### Report Title: ZDEM: A Discrete Element Numerical Simulation Software for Structural Deformation Research: Theory, Software, and Applications
#### Time: 16:45-17:10, October 23rd
#### Location: Zhuhai · Zhuhai International Convention Center**Room 402**

**Presenter:**[**Changsheng Li**](https://geovbox.com/about/lichangsheng/)  
**Report Abstract:**  
With the gradual development of China's petroleum geological theory and exploration practices, oil and gas exploration has shifted towards deep basins. How to carry out deep structural research in petroliferous basins has become a frontier issue in basin structural research. Conducting quantitative research from the perspective of discrete element numerical simulation can provide quantitative experimental evidence for deep structural analysis. Discrete element numerical simulation has high requirements for the computing environment, so it is particularly important to develop a high-performance discrete element numerical simulation software suitable for structural deformation research. This report will introduce the past and future of the discrete element numerical simulation software ZDEM from three aspects: theory, software, and applications.

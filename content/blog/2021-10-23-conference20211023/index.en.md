The 2021 CCF National Academic Conference on High-Performance Computing (CCF HPC China 2021) was grandly held in Hengqin, Zhuhai from October 21st to 23rd. With the theme of "Empowering Intelligence, Building a Shared Future," the conference aimed to foresee global trends in supercomputing technology, bring together innovative technological applications, showcase cutting-edge academic achievements, promote the digital transformation and upgrading of supercomputing in academia, industry, and research, and create a global, open, and academic exchange platform.

CCF HPC China 2021 was hosted by the China Computer Federation (CCF), and co-organized by the High-Performance Computing Professional Committee of the China Computer Federation, the Management Committee of Zhuhai Hengqin New Area, the Zhuhai Science and Technology Innovation Bureau, the University of Macau, and the Macau University of Science and Technology. It was also supported by Beijing Parallel Technologies Co., Ltd., Jinan University, Guangdong Qinzhi Technology Research Institute Co., Ltd., and Zhuhai Da Hengqin Co., Ltd.

At the 8th Forum on Domestic Application Software during this academic conference, key developers of domestic application software gathered to jointly discuss the current status and development bottlenecks of domestic application software, the support needed, market promotion strategies, and future development trends. It is hoped that China's domestic application software can continue to develop steadily with the support of multiple parties and occupy a place in the mainstream international market.

During the event, Dr. Li Changsheng from East China University of Technology delivered a presentation on the theme of "ZDEM: A Discrete Element Numerical Simulation Software for Structural Deformation Research: Theory, Software, and Applications". With the gradual development of China's oil and gas geological theories and exploration practices, oil and gas exploration has shifted towards the deep basins. How to carry out deep structural research in petroliferous basins has become a frontier issue in basin structural research. Conducting quantitative research from the perspective of discrete element numerical simulation can provide quantitative experimental evidence for deep structural analysis. Discrete element numerical simulation has high requirements for the computing environment, so it is particularly important to develop a high-performance discrete element numerical simulation software suitable for structural deformation research. Subsequently, he introduced the principles of discrete elements and the parallel design based on OpenMP and CUDA. He also shared the applications of ZDEM in structural simulation and its future prospects.

Finally, Dr. Chen Jian, the chairman and moderator of the forum and the general manager of Beijing Parallel Technologies Co., Ltd., expressed in his closing remarks that domestic application software still lacks underlying core technologies, which involves not only software products but also complex domain-specific knowledge, computer technology, mathematics, and physics. This is the construction of a series of underlying ecosystems that require long-term significant investments. There is still a long way to go in building the ecosystem. In terms of the overall environment, the domestic application software market is also beginning to mature, with more companies willing to pay for genuine software and use domestic software. Coupled with continuous policy dividends, we can see that the overall maturity of the domestic application software market is rapidly improving. We look forward to meeting everyone again at the 9th Domestic Application Software Forum to discuss the new development of domestic application software.

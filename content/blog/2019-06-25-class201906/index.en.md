The course begins with an explanation of the principles of the discrete element method, followed by an introduction to the usage of VBOX. In the practical session, various examples are demonstrated, and example scripts are provided.
To allow participants to learn through practice, the course will provide one day's free access to a cluster with VBOX installed，For continued use of VBOX, please apply for an account following the [Nanjing University High-Performance Computing Center Account Activation Instructions](https://doc.geovbox.com/latest/hpc/) apply for an account.

The Nanjing University High-Performance Computing Center's cluster ranked first in the Chinese High-Performance Computing University Systems in 2009. It was ranked 284th in the global TOP500 list of supercomputers released in June 2017.At the Nanjing University High-Performance Computing Center [http://hpcc.nju.edu.cn](http://hpcc.nju.edu.cn) ，not only can VBOX be used for structural numerical simulations, but it also provides high-performance scientific computing services for research in various related disciplines.

#### abstract

Over the past decade, the development of shale gas in the southwestern Sichuan foreland thrust belt, China, has led to a significant increase in induced seismicity, including one of the world's largest hydraulic fracturing (HF)‐related induced earthquake (ML 5.4), occurring in the Weiyuan anticline. Here, we investigated the structural and mechanical evolution of the Weiyuan anticline and its relationship with HF‐induced earthquakes using seismic interpretation, the discrete‐element method (DEM), and three‐dimensional structural modeling. Interpretation of the seismic reflection profiles revealed a basement‐involved wedge structure and two west‐dipping multi‐bending thrust ramps in the basement. East of the Weiyuan anticline, extensive small‐ displacement thrust faults developed between the Cambrian and Silurian shale detachments in the sedimentary cover. DEM simulation showed that the structural wedge formed by the underlying blind thrust ramp and back thrust (BT) controlled the Weiyuan anticline formation. With increased shortening, the fault slip continued to propagate east of the Weiyuan anticline along the Cambrian detachment, leading to the development of
extensive thrust faults. 3‐D structural modeling showed that M > 4 induced earthquakes were primarily located on a BT in the structural wedge, while M < 4 events were distributed along the hydro‐fractured Silurian shale and Cambrian detachment. Densely developed thrust faults in the sedimentary cover connect the overpressured Silurian shale to the Cambrian detachment, promoting the downward diffusion of fluid pressure and favoring micro‐small M < 4 induced seismic events. This study provides new insights into the seismic hazard assessment of HF development in fold‐and‐thrust belts.

### Conclusions

Combined with structural interpretation, DEM simulations, and 3-D modeling, this study revealed the structure, kinematics, and mechanical evolution of a preexisting basement-involved structural wedge beneath the Weiyuan anticline and multiple detachments of the sedimentary cover in the southwestern Sichuan foreland fold-and-thrust belt, China, and discussed their influences on induced seismicity. Based on our study results, the following conclusions were drawn:
(1)The Weiyuan anticline is formed by a preexisting basement-involved contractional wedge consisting of a basal thrust ramp and a back thrust fault. East of the Weiyuan limb, the fault slip continued to propagate along the Cambrian detachment, contributing to the development of extensive low-displacement thrusts that cut through the Silurian shale detachment. 
(2) The earthquakes induced in the Weiyuan block were primarily controlled by preexisting compressional basement-involved thrust structures and multi-level detachments in the sedimentary cover. The largest induced earthquake (2019 ML 5.2 event), along with other M > 4 earthquakes, occurred on BT within the basement-involved wedge structure. 
(3) In the sedimentary cover, induced earthquakes (M < 4) primarily occurred between the Silurian shale and the middle–upper Cambrian shale detachments. Densely developed thrust faults connect the high-pore-pressure Silurian shale with Cambrian shale detachment, promoting the downward diffusion of pore pressure, which enhances the occurrence of induced earthquakes.

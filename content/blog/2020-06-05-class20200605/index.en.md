### Course Introduction (Three Reports)

This session invites graduate students Xu Wenqiao from Nanjing University and Xin Wen from Zhejiang University to explain their research published in the Journal of Geology.

1. Application: Tectonic Simulation Based on Discrete Elements

    - Presenter: Li Changsheng
    - Content Summary:
        - Main controlling factors of fold-thrust structures
        - Compressive structures of dual detachment layers: Kuqa
        - Deep-shallow structural coupling and polycyclic structural superposition: Southwestern Tarim
    
2. Numerical Simulation Analysis of the Evolutionary Differences in Sub-salt Structural Deformation of the Eastern and Western Segments of the Kuqa Depression

    - Presenter: Xu Wenqiao

    - Content Summary:


        - Geological overview of the Kuqa Depression region
            - Eastern and Western segments
            - Southern and Northern zones
            - Upper and Lower stratification
        - Initial model setup:
            - Experiment 1: No pre-existing faults - no homogenous sedimentation model;
            - Experiment 2: Weakly cohesive detachment layer initial model;
            - Experiment 3: No pre-existing faults - homogenous sedimentation model;
            - Experiment 4: Pre-existing faults - homogenous sedimentation model;
            - Experiment 5: Strong salt rock layer model.
        - Simulation results and analysis:
            - Pre-existing faults influence the propagation manner of fold-thrust structures, resulting in differences in the morphology of sub-salt wedges, number of fractures, and surface structural patterns;
            - Homogeneous sedimentation and the nature of different detachment layers primarily affect the extent of vertical decoupling deformation in saline fold-thrust belts, with homogeneous sedimentation enhancing decoupling deformation above and below the salt, while an increase in detachment layer properties weakens the decoupling deformation.

3. Study on the Controlling Factors of Structural Deformation of the Fore-thrust Belt at the Southwestern Tianshan Based on Discrete Element Numerical Simulation

    - Presenter: Xin Wen
    - Content Summary：
        - Introduction to geological background: distribution map and survey line positions of the fold-thrust belt in the northwestern margin of the Kashgar region of Xinjiang.
        - Initial model setup:
            - Experiment 1: Initial model with pre-existing faults;
            - Experiment 2: Weakly cohesive detachment layer initial model;
            - Experiment 3: Pre-existing faults - weakly cohesive detachment layer initial model;
            - Experiment 4: Pre-existing faults - moderately cohesive detachment layer initial model;
            - Experiment 5: Pre-existing faults - strongly cohesive detachment layer initial model.
        - Simulation results and analysis:
            - Effects of pre-existing faults and detachment layers on the deformation of the thrust belt;
            - Influence of detachment layer strength on the structural deformation of the study area.

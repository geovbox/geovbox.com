Discrete Element Method (DEM) numerical simulation has emerged as a pivotal approach for investigating tectonic deformation processes and mechanisms. This technique effectively overcomes the rheological and scaling limitations inherent in physical analog modeling. In contrast to continuum-based numerical methods, DEM simulates system dynamics through particle-particle interactions, enabling researchers to directly observe and quantify kinematic evolution. Its unique capacity to accommodate large interparticle displacements makes it particularly suited for modeling high-strain deformation, offering distinct advantages in addressing geological problems related to structural deformation.

Our team presented the research **The Influence of Detachment Zone Strength on Compressional Tectonics: A Discrete Element Modeling Approach** at the 2017 Annual Meeting of the Chinese Geoscience Union (CGU) as a [poster

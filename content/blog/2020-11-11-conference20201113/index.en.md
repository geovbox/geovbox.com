- **Abstract**

    Numerical simulation, along with theoretical analysis and scientific experiments, forms one of the three pillars of modern scientific research. In the field of tectonic geology, numerical simulation has become an important tool ranging from the dynamics of supercontinent rifting to the geometric and kinematic studies of basin tectonic deformation.

    In recent years, with the development of discrete element theory and computer technology, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) ([Cundall and Strack, 1979](chrome-extension://ebldafnijcbblaaabcehdamipojmicmg/index.html#refer-anchor-1)) has been widely applied to tectonic simulations at different scales. Compared to traditional sandbox modeling methods, discrete element methods can more precisely control experimental boundary conditions and quantitatively analyze tectonic deformation processes, aiding in a deeper understanding of the mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms at the micro-scale. The discrete element method employs discrete particles to represent rocks that conform to real physical and mechanical properties, effectively analyzing problems with numerous discontinuities. Since the 1990s, DEM has been widely used to address tectonically related geological issues. For example, it has been used to analyze the cracking mechanisms of sedimentary cover layers during salt piercement, study the effects of cohesion within strata on tectonic morphology and stress-strain distribution ([Morgan, 2015](chrome-extension://ebldafnijcbblaaabcehdamipojmicmg/index.html#refer-anchor-3)), reveal changes in strain distribution and fracture generation patterns in the deformation process of décollements under horizontal compression, clarify the dynamic evolution in layered extensional superposition during basin evolution, and analyze the inversion tectonic characteristics of the Maodong fault zone as a graben basin under current regional stress and the reverse control of normal faulting, revealing the fault propagation and connectivity processes during the development of pure strike-slip basins, and discussing the controlling factors and mechanisms of the salt structures in the western Kuqa foreland thrust belt ([Li Changsheng, 2019](chrome-extension://ebldafnijcbblaaabcehdamipojmicmg/index.html#refer-anchor-1)).

    Schreurs et al. ([2016](chrome-extension://ebldafnijcbblaaabcehdamipojmicmg/index.html#refer-Schreurs-2016)) compared compressional tectonic experiments from multiple physical modeling laboratories worldwide, showing that under the same experimental conditions and methods, different experimental simulation outcomes cannot be entirely consistent. However, under the same initial conditions (initial particle positions and radii) and boundary conditions, the discrete element results consistently exhibit reproducibility. Furthermore, the material properties of DEM can be calibrated through microparameters, and a variety of materials can be selected. All variables can be monitored in real-time, such as displacement, stress, strain, velocity, and energy. In physical simulations, deformation needs to be observed through image analysis (such as Particle Image Velocimetry), laser scanning (mini laser altimetry), and computed X-ray tomography scans. Without these devices, the only way to observe model deformation is to photograph the side of the model or cut the model to inspect internal deformation. In contrast, discrete elements can provide all information for each deformation stage, allowing calculations of the stress-strain fields in the system. Moreover, with the same initial model, consistent simulation results facilitate the study of single-factor variables (such as compression rates, paleouplift, pre-existing faults, etc.).

    In summary, the discrete element numerical simulation method has obvious advantages in the quantitative analysis of tectonic morphology, fault prediction, and stress-strain. Many scholars have introduced discrete elements into simulations of tectonic deformation; however, the analysis has often focused on qualitative interpretations of structural geometries. This paper combines a typical compressional tectonic discrete element numerical simulation experiment to simulate the formation process of tectonics under horizontal compression and to analyze the changes in stress and strain distribution and fracture generation patterns during the deformation process. The results indicate that: (1) Fractures and faults are closely related; a large concentration of fractures in a localized area is the precursor to fault formation. (2) Volumetric strain can characterize fracture types (tensile or compressive), while deformation strain can differentiate between forward and reverse thrust faults. (3) The magnitude of average stress is positively correlated with topographic relief, with maximum shear stress accumulating at new faults about to form until the new fault forms, after which the shear stress begins to dissipate and continues to accumulate at the next new fault about to form. These findings demonstrate the significant potential of the discrete element method in stress-strain analysis and fracture prediction research.

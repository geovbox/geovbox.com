#### Abstract
 The physical properties of subduction inputs profoundly influence megathrust slip behavior. Seismic data reveal  extensive polygonal fault systems (PFSs) in the input sequences of the Hikurangi Margin and Nankai Trough. The  mechanical and hydrological effects of these incoming PFSs on subduction zones are potentially substantial.  Here, we investigate their effects following transport into the accretionary wedge by integrating discrete- element  modeling with three- dimensional seismic interpretation. We find that the typical dips of the incoming PFSs over lap with modeled dips prone to reactivation and confirm that subducting PFSs can be reactivated and gradually  evolve into major thrust faults. Comparisons with electromagnetic data indicate that PFSs may provide conduits  for fluid leakage along the plate interface, coincide with disrupted strata and decreased shear stress, and enhance  geometric and stress heterogeneity along the megathrust. These suggest that PFSs may play a previously unrec ognized role in contributing to shallow slow earthquake phenomena in subduction zones

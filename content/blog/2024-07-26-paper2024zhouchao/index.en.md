The classical Coulomb critical wedge theory is the fundamental theory for explaining the growth process of thrust wedges (Chapple, 1978; Dahlen, 1990; Davis and Engelder, 1985; Davis et al., 1983). This theory posits that the deformation of a thrust wedge develops sequentially from the hinterland to the foreland, meaning that distal deformation occurs latest. However, increasing geological evidence suggests that the northern Tibetan and Iranian Plateaus, far from the southern collision zones, experienced deformation shortly after the collision of India and Arabia with Eurasia (Fig. 1). Furthermore, although a weak lower crust and distal pre-existing faults (or weak zones) are common, their relationship with early distal deformation remains unclear.

To address the above issues, Dr. Jiankun He, a researcher at the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and his team, including doctoral student Zhou Chao, Associate Researcher Wang Weimin, Senior Engineer Wang Xinguo, doctoral students Zhao Youjia and Jiang Yong, collaborated with Dr. Hao Su from the School of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China. Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 42120104004, 42174112) and the "Second Tibetan Plateau Comprehensive Scientific Expedition and Research Program" (No. 2019QZKK0707), they used ZDEM (Li Changsheng, 2019) to conduct discrete element numerical simulation experiments and perform stress-strain analysis (Morgan, 2015), exploring the relationship between distal pre-existing faults, basal décollement, and early distal deformation propagation.

**Discrete element numerical simulation experiments show：**

1. The presence of pre-existing faults is a necessary condition for the occurrence of early distal deformation;
2. Whether distal pre-existing faults deform early depends on the strength of the basal décollement and is independent of the model width; a strong basal décollement cannot activate distal pre-existing faults, whereas a weak basal décollement can cause them to deform early;
3. In the case of a weak basal décollement, a slower shortening rate not only facilitates greater shortening absorption by the distal pre-existing fault at the early stage, but also results in a more pronounced deviation from the sequentially-forward deformation propagation.

These findings demonstrate that **the preferential deformation of distal pre-existing faults is mechanically controlled by a weak basal décollement layer**.Combining geological and geophysical observations, we suggest that the **early deformations observed in the northern Tibetan and Iranian Plateaus shortly after the collision of the Arabian and Indian plates with the Eurasian plate are likely the result of the preferential reactivation of pre-existing faults (weak zones) under the influence of a weak lower crust**[(Zhou et al., 2024)](#refer-zhou2024)。

#### Abstract
Coulomb critical wedge theory predicts that thrust wedges would grow sequentially from the hinterland to the
foreland, meaning that distal deformation occurs last. However, in the northern Tibetan and Iranian Plateaus, far
away from the southern collision zones, widespread deformation occurs soon after collisions of Arabia and India
with Eurasia. Additionally, despite the prevalence of weak lower crust and distal pre-existing faults or weak
zones, their relationship to early distal deformation remains poorly understood. For this reason, we run systematic
experiments of discrete element models involving basal d´ecollement layer as well as distal pre-existing
fault. Our model results reveal that (1) the presence of pre-existing faults is necessary for the occurrence of early
distal deformation; (2) the early deformation of distal pre-existing fault is dependent on basal d´ecollement
strength and independent of model width; (3) strong basal d´ecollement fails to activate the distal pre-existing
faults, instead weak basal d´ecollement can deform them at the early stage; (4) in the presence of weak basal
d´ecollement, a slower shortening rate not only facilitates greater shortening absorption by the distal pre-existing
fault at the early stage but also results in a more pronounced deviation from sequentially-forward deformation
propagation. These findings demonstrate that the preferential reactivation deformations of distal pre-existing
faults are mechanically controlled by a weak basal d´ecollement layer. Together with geological and geophysical
observations, we suggest that the early deformations of northern Tibetan and Iranian Plateaus may be the
result of the reactivation of pre-existing faults due to the existence of weak lower crust soon after collisions.

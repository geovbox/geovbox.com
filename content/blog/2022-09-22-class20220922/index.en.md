On September 22, 2022, the 7th numerical simulation practice course was successfully held at the College of Oceanography, Hohai University. Professor Wang Maomao from Hohai University, along with 7 graduate students from Hohai University and 3 graduate students from Nanjing University, participated in the training. We thank the teachers and students for their support.

To date, VBOX/ZDEM software training has been successfully held seven times:

1. April 2019, Nanjing University
- June 2019, Nanjing University
- December 2019, East China University of Technology
- January 2020, China National Petroleum Corporation Exploration and Development Research Institute
- May 2020, China University of Geosciences (Beijing) Online https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1st4y1C7b5?p=1
- July 2021, zdem2.1@Parallel Supercomputing Cloud Live Exchange Online https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1m64y1z7dR
- September 2022, Hohai University

**Students who have not participated in the ZDEM structural numerical simulation practice course can self-study** [Primary Tutorial of Discrete Element Numerical Simulation Software ZDEM](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av91259173/)

Location: College of Oceanography, Hohai University
Time: September 22, 2022 (Thursday), 14:00-17:00
Lecturer: Changsheng Li, ZDEM Developer 
Content:

- Theory: Structural Simulation and Discrete Element Method
- Software: Introduction and Operation Demonstration of ZDEM

During the practical session, the example [Learning ZDEM with One Example](/example/ex1_push/)was explained, and 9 example scripts were provided.
Among them, 7 examples are publicly available:

- [Learning ZDEM with One Example](/example/ex1_push/) 
- [Erosion](/example/ex2_syn_erosion/) 
- [Sedimentation](/example/ex3_syn_sedimentaion/) 
- [Fault](/example/ex4_pre_struct/) 
- [Detachment](/example/ex5_detachment/) 
- [Palaeohigh](/example/ex6_palaeohigh/) 
- [Extensional Structure with Rigid Basement](/example/ex7_extens_rigid/)
- Extensional Structure with Ductile Basement (To be released)
- Arbitrary Shape Basement Generation (To be released)

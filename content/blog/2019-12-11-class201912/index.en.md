This course will be conducted in two sessions: theoretical lectures on the first day and practical hands-on exercises on the second day.  

The VBOX will be installed on [four high-performance computing platforms](https://geovbox.com/hpc/), and participants will receive one day of free access to the computing platform during the course.   
To continue using VBOX, please apply for an account according to the [Nanjing University High-Performance Computing Center account activation method](https://doc.geovbox.com/latest/hpc/).

### Day One: Theory

- Title: Quantitative Analysis and Simulation of Tectonic Deformation Based on Discrete Element Method
- Time: December 19, 2019 (Thursday), 8:00 AM - 10:00 AM
- Location: East China University of Technology (Nanchang Campus), Teaching Building 3, Room 518
- Presenter: Dr. Li Changsheng
- Content: Discrete Element Theory and Application Examples

### Day Two: Practice



- Title: Learning VBOX through an Example
- Time: December 20, 2019 (Friday), 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM
- Location: East China University of Technology (Nanchang Campus), Geosciences Building, Room A509
- Presenter: VBOX Developer Li Changsheng
- Target Audience: Researchers in structural numerical simulation with no prior experience
- **Important Note**: This course is a hands-on practical course; participants are required to bring their own laptops. Due to limited computational resources, if you plan to participate in this practical course, please contact [Li Changsheng](https://geovbox.com/about/lichangsheng/) in advance.

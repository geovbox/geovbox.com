If you need to use VBOX, apply for an account following the [Nanjing University High-Performance Computing Center Account Activation Method](https://doc.geovbox.com/latest/hpc/).

The Nanjing University High-Performance Computing Center cluster was the first in China's high-performance computing system among universities in 2009. It ranked 284th in the global TOP500 list of supercomputers released in June 2017. At the Nanjing University High-Performance Computing Center ([http://hpcc.nju.edu.cn](http://hpcc.nju.edu.cn/)), not only can VBOX be used for tectonic numerical simulation, but also high-performance scientific computing services can be provided for research work in various related disciplines.
